            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Successful public service delivery depends on leaders fluent in the language of delivery, teams with the skills to manage outcomes, and governance that clears the path—whether work is done in-house or with partners. Too often, leaders are accountable for results without knowing what good looks like, what questions to ask, or when they're being sold expensive theater.</p>
                <p>Public institutions deliver when policy, design, and technology work together—not sequential handoffs, but integrated teams. That means structures built for multidisciplinary co-creation, governance that supports test-and-learn approaches, and relentless focus on end users. When those conditions don't exist, even the best policy intent produces little.</p>
                <p>My work sits in that gap between mandate and execution. I help leaders build delivery capacity in practice: clarifying decision rights, standing up empowered cross-functional teams, and designing governance that allows policy, funding, and delivery to move together rather than in silos. I'm most often brought in when programs are politically sensitive, vendor-heavy, or stuck—when success depends less on hiring more consultants and more on building the muscle to deliver.</p>

    <section id="about">
        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
            <div class="section-content">
                <p>I've spent my career working at the intersection of government, technology, and leadership—co-founding 18F, serving as Ontario's first Chief Digital and Data Officer and leading the Ontario Digital Service, and advising public-interest organizations and boards, including North Guide.</p>
                <p>Across these roles, I've seen the same pattern repeat: initiatives fail not because teams lack talent or intent, but because institutions aren't designed to support delivery. My work is grounded in a simple belief—governments and public-interest institutions earn trust through reliability.</p>
                <p>That requires leaders fluent in the language of delivery, teams with the skills to manage outcomes, and governance that clears the path—whether you're building in-house or working with partners.</p>
